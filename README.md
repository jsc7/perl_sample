This is a perl script that splits a structured data file at each entry so that each entry becomes its own file (e.g., temp.1, temp.2, temp3). 

This is useful in breaking up a structured data file to multiple files, where each data point becomes its own file after the script is run. 

In this case, the split takes place at "<\!-- documentid"
